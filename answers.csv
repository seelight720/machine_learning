City is the center of a region and gains rapid development by concentrating a large number of industries and populations through the polarization effect. With the expansion of the city's scale and economic strength, the city has a radiation-driven effect on the surrounding areas, forming a city circle or metropolitan area(Hasi et al., 2012). Along with the improvement of inter-city transportation facilities, especially the expansion of highways and railroads, the radiation areas of neighboring cities are getting closer and even partially overlapping(Yza et al.). The increasing accessibility of cities to each other induces a large number of inter-city travelers. Basic activities such as living and working that originally existed within the same city spread to neighboring cities in the metropolitan area, creating a pattern of dispersal of basic urban functions in different cities(Cong et al., 2014). As it is increasingly common to choose to work and live in different cities and to commute longer distances, inter-city commuting links are becoming an object to reflect inter-city functional links and to study regional patterns. Intercity commuting, as the main mode of inter-city employment and residential linkage, can promote inter-city linkage and also enhance economic synergy, but also cause local traffic pressure.
Intercity commuting is defined as the non-overlapping of two urban administrative areas where one lives and works (Paredes et al., 2017). There are three main reasons why inter-city commuting arises. First, the huge difference in housing costs drives urban residents to live around the city to reduce the cost of living. Second, the improvement of urban and inter-city transportation systems continues to improve travel accessibility and mobility, making it possible for individuals to make inter-city job and housing choices. Thirdly, the gradual relaxation of cross-city uses of public services such as housing fund and medical insurance, as well as the "cross-province access" to government services, have significantly increased the willingness of inter-city commuting.
Compared with intra-city commuting, inter-city commuting is characterized by long distances, time-consuming and complex and diverse modes. Not only that, the travel pattern of inter-city commuting is subject to a variety of factors. However, inter-city commuting is currently not given much attention and the impact it has is often overlooked[WX]. XXX shows [WX] that inter-city commuters account for xx% of the commuters in Beijing. In California, 16% of cross-city trips are for commuting purposes(Bierce and Kurth, 2014). According to a survey by XXX, 90% of inter-city commuting trips are made by private car transportation mode of choice [WX], causing more serious traffic congestion, air pollution, noise and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, inter-city commuting is closely related to personal health, affecting people's sleep and mental health.
In addition, inter-city commuting has significant characteristics in terms of commuting frequency. The large span of inter-city travel in time and space gives it a unique travel pattern compared to intra-city commuting. For intra-city commuting, the general commuting distance is shorter and commuting time spent is within 1 hour, forming a common travel pattern of leaving for work in the morning and returning home in the evening. For inter-city commuters, it costs more time and money, and causes more physical and mental stress. Therefore, some inter-city commuters choose to find a temporary place to live in their workplace, such as a rental house or company dormitory. These people usually have inter-city commuting behavior near holidays, while the rest of the time is for intra-city commuting, which is called weekly commuters in this paper. And those who commute between their workplace and residence every day are called daily commuters, as shown in Fig. 1.
In fact, researchers have found significant differences in the commuting frequency characteristics of inter-city commuting in the early days, but they have not attracted widespread attention. Taking the labor market in northern Sweden as an example, XXX found that people living in southern Sweden mostly have a weekly commute. Research from some European countries shows that the number of both daily and weekly commuters is increasing year by year [WX]. At the macro level, the weekly commute is a way to address the imbalance between regional labor supply and demand. At the micro level, the weekly commuting pattern is an alternative to personal or family relocation [WX14]. For the choice of commuting frequency mode, some commuters are liberal and some commuters are passive. This choice is constrained by economic, family, policy and other factors. For example, the daily commute has higher commuting costs, while the weekly commuting mode provides less family companionship. This raises the question of how commuters should weigh the pros and cons of these choices.
The rest of the paper is structured in five parts. Section 2 reviews the main research directions on inter-city commuting. Section 3 describes the data collection methods and the principles of Bayesian networks. Section 4 first discusses the characteristics of various aspects of inter-city commuting, then uses Bayesian networks to analysis the factors influencing the inter-city commuting frequency patterns. In the final section, the conclusions and suggestions of the study are offered, followed by recommendations for further work.
In the last century, the neo-classical spatial-economic urban models have been proposed, which suggest that the location of household residence is determined by a combination of commuting costs and housing costs(Alonso, 1964; Mills, 1972). Assuming that wages, housing prices and population density are low outside the central business district, commuting is determined by the equilibrium state of the housing and employment markets. Consequently, commuting costs can be compensated by the housing market, and households may choose to live further away from their workplace in exchange for lower housing costs(Plaut, 2006; Renkow and Hoover, 2010). Within a metropolitan area, when the job market is concentrated in the same city, this long-distance commute evolves into an inter-city commute.
Therefore, inter-city commuting is caused by an increase in commuting distance. Housing costs and income are the underlying causes of increased commuting distances. Income or income prospects dictate that people buy the appropriate house in the appropriate place(Haas and Osland, 2014). Spatial differences in house prices may determine commuting distances and influence whether households can relocate or stay in different places(Zabel, 2012). Low-income workers will shift to lower-density housing to reduce housing costs, but will also face increased commuting distances(Blumenberg and King, 2019). The shortage of affordable housing will also result in increased commuting distances for low-income workers(Blumenberg and King, 2021; Zhao, 2015). Higher income households commute closer because they can afford more expensive neighbourhoods(Islam and Saphores, 2022).
In addition, in addition, the growing construction of inter-city transport facilities has contributed to the growth of inter-city commuting. For example, high-speed rail networks have reshaped and will continue to reshape urban spatial accessibility, stimulating inter-city commuting(Arbues et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). As the labor market diversifies and the number of dual-career households increases, it also stimulates an increase in the number of inter-city commutes(Plaut, 2006). It is becoming increasingly difficult for couples to find work in the same geographic area, and inter-city commuting can be an alternative to the traditional solution of one partner sacrificing a career for the other(Haskey, 2005).
The factors influencing inter-city commuting intentions are also a major research focus for researchers in recent decades(Chen et al., 2021).
Socio-demographic factors play a crucial role in the decision making of inter-city commuting. Gender and family composition are all important determinants of inter-city commuting(Limtanakool et al., 2010). Research has found that male employees are more willing to inter-city commute than female employees(Bernadette et al., 2018; Cassel et al., 2013; Hjorthol and Vagane, 2014), and the majority of female inter-city commuters do not have children(Reuschke, 2010). Some studies have shown that higher-income households have longer commuting distances and a higher probability of inter-city commuting(Dieleman et al., 2002; Morency et al., 2011). However, high income people commute less in Birmingham, USA(Sultana and Weber, 2007). The relationship between age and inter-city commuting is non-linear, with the youngest and oldest workers tending to be closer to their workplace than those aged 35 to 45.(Maoh and Tang, 2012; Morency et al., 2011). In addition, commuters who are employed full-time have longer commute distances and a greater proportion of inter-city commutes(Axisa et al., 2012; Manaugh et al., 2010; Morency et al., 2011).
Other factors related to inter-city commuting decisions that have been studied include educational background, socioeconomic and government policy. For example, higher educational backgrounds increase inter-city commuting and other long-distance trips(Lamondia et al., 2014). Some socio-economic factors, such as population density, number of jobs, and accessibility of the transportation network, can impact the decision and frequency of inter-city commuting(Limtanakool et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Urban growth controls will also increase inter-city commuting flows(Ogura, 2005).
There are few studies related to the frequency of inter-city commuting, but it has long been suggested that inter-city commuting differs between daily and weekly commuting. One study found that commuters in Sweden with long commuting distances were not conducted on a daily basis but weekly(Sandow, 2008). Many families must accept weekly commuting patterns in order to avoid the impact of relocation on partners or children(Lyons and Chatterjee, 2008). General trends in several European countries show an increase in both the number of daily commuters and weekly commuters(Sultana and Weber, 2007; Zhao et al., 2020). 
In summary, current research on inter-city commuting focuses on three primary aspects: reasons for the generation of inter-city commuting, the determinants of inter-city commuting, and the choice of commuting mode. In addition, according to the inter-city commuting frequency characteristics, inter-city commuters can be classified into two patterns: daily commuters and weekly commuters. As long-distance and large-scale inter-regional travel activities become more frequent, the number of people opting for weekly commutes has also increased. The analysis of inter-city commuting into two patterns from the perspective of commuting frequency is useful in quantifying the travel demand for each pattern and providing guidance for transport facility planning. For example, the layout of transport hubs, access options, planning of public transport facilities and planning of parking facilities are matched to the characteristics of each commuting pattern. The study from the perspective of two inter-city commuting frequency patterns (inter-CFP) which includes the weekly commute and the daily commute can explore the travel patterns and travel characteristics of inter-city commuting better. Although scholars have found differences in inter-CFP among inter-city commuters long ago, few studies have focused on it. This paper focuses on analyzing the differences in inter-city commuting frequency and the factors affecting mode choice to provide ideas for solving the contradiction between income, housing and employment.
