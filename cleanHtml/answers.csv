content|City is the center of a region and gains rapid development by concentrating a large number of industries and populations through the polarization effect. With the expansion of the city's scale and economic strength, the city has a radiation-driven effect on the surrounding areas, forming a city circle or metropolitan area(Hasi et al., 2012). Along with the improvement of inter-city transportation facilities, especially the expansion of highways and railroads, the radiation areas of neighboring cities are getting closer and even partially overlapping(Yza et al.). The increasing accessibility of cities to each other induces a large number of inter-city travelers. Basic activities such as living and working that originally existed within the same city spread to neighboring cities in the metropolitan area, creating a pattern of dispersal of basic urban functions in different cities(Cong et al., 2014). As it is increasingly common to choose to work and live in different cities and to commute longer distances, inter-city commuting links are becoming an object to reflect inter-city functional links and to study regional patterns. Intercity commuting, as the main mode of inter-city employment and residential linkage, can promote inter-city linkage and also enhance economic synergy, but also cause local traffic pressure.
Intercity commuting is defined as the non-overlapping of two urban administrative areas where one lives and works (Paredes et al., 2017). There are three main reasons why inter-city commuting arises. First, the huge difference in housing costs drives urban residents to live around the city to reduce the cost of living. Second, the improvement of urban and inter-city transportation systems continues to improve travel accessibility and mobility, making it possible for individuals to make inter-city job and housing choices. Thirdly, the gradual relaxation of cross-city uses of public services such as housing fund and medical insurance, as well as the "cross-province access" to government services, have significantly increased the willingness of inter-city commuting.
Compared with intra-city commuting, inter-city commuting is characterized by long distances, time-consuming and complex and diverse modes. Not only that, the travel pattern of inter-city commuting is subject to a variety of factors. However, inter-city commuting is currently not given much attention and the impact it has is often overlooked[WX]. XXX shows [WX] that inter-city commuters account for xx% of the commuters in Beijing. In California, 16% of cross-city trips are for commuting purposes(Bierce and Kurth, 2014). According to a survey by XXX, 90% of inter-city commuting trips are made by private car transportation mode of choice [WX], causing more serious traffic congestion, air pollution, noise and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, inter-city commuting is closely related to personal health, affecting people's sleep and mental health.
In addition, inter-city commuting has significant characteristics in terms of commuting frequency. The large span of inter-city travel in time and space gives it a unique travel pattern compared to intra-city commuting. For intra-city commuting, the general commuting distance is shorter and commuting time spent is within 1 hour, forming a common travel pattern of leaving for work in the morning and returning home in the evening. For inter-city commuters, it costs more time and money, and causes more physical and mental stress. Therefore, some inter-city commuters choose to find a temporary place to live in their workplace, such as a rental house or company dormitory. These people usually have inter-city commuting behavior near holidays, while the rest of the time is for intra-city commuting, which is called weekly commuters in this paper. And those who commute between their workplace and residence every day are called daily commuters, as shown in Fig. 1.
In fact, researchers have found significant differences in the commuting frequency characteristics of inter-city commuting in the early days, but they have not attracted widespread attention. Taking the labor market in northern Sweden as an example, XXX found that people living in southern Sweden mostly have a weekly commute. Research from some European countries shows that the number of both daily and weekly commuters is increasing year by year [WX]. At the macro level, the weekly commute is a way to address the imbalance between regional labor supply and demand. At the micro level, the weekly commuting pattern is an alternative to personal or family relocation [WX14]. For the choice of commuting frequency mode, some commuters are liberal and some commuters are passive. This choice is constrained by economic, family, policy and other factors. For example, the daily commute has higher commuting costs, while the weekly commuting mode provides less family companionship. This raises the question of how commuters should weigh the pros and cons of these choices
